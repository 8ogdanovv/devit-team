---

## Flatten Object

### Task Description
Write a function to flatten a nested object into a flat map with '/' separated keys.

Create a function `mapObject` that flattens a nested object into a flat map.

---

## Combinations

### Task Description
Generate combinations of positive integers that sum to a given number.

Write a function `combos` that generates combinations of positive integers that sum to a given number.

---

## Function Chaining

### Task Description
Create a function `add` that can be chained to sum up numbers.

Write a function `add` that can be chained to sum up numbers as demonstrated.
