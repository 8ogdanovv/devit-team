  <p>
    <u>Using Git for code management is a great solution</u>, but <em>there are
    <strong>a few additional steps</strong> and best practices</em>,
    that can improve your code's overall maintainability and client collaboration:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Create a .gitignore file:</strong>
      Create a .gitignore file to exclude files and folders that should not go into the repository
      (for example, temporary files, dependencies, IDE settings files).
      This will help keep the repository clean. Here's an example .gitignore for a JavaScript project:

      <code title=".gitignore">
        <pre>
          # Exclude temporary files and directories
          node_modules/
          .cache/

          # Exclude IDE settings files
          .vscode/
          .idea/
        </pre>
      </code>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Create a development branch:
      </strong>
      It is a good practice to create a development branch (for example, develop)
      in which you will develop and integrate new features.
      Once the code has been tested and is ready for release, you can merge it into the master branch for release.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Use commit comments:
      </strong>
      Try to write informative commit comments to make it clear what changes have been made.
      Well-formatted comments will help you and other developers understand the history of changes in the project.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Continuous Integration (CI):
      </strong>
      Set up a CI system such as Travis CI, CircleCI, GitHub Actions,
      and others to automate the process of building and testing your code with every commit.
      This will allow you to quickly identify and correct errors.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Pull Request (PR) or Merge Request (MR):
      </strong>
      Instead of directly uploading code to master, it is recommended to create a PR or MR.
      This allows other developers to review and discuss changes before merging them into master.
      You will be able to get feedback and ensure that the code meets the standards.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Versioning:
      </strong>
      Place tags on release versions of your code.
      This makes it easy to go back to specific versions and track changes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Documentation:
      </strong>
      Maintain project documentation, including a README file with installation and usage instructions.
      This will help other developers and users quickly understand the project.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>
        Dependency version control:
      </strong>
      Use package.json files (for Node.js projects) or similar for other languages and platforms.
      This allows dependency versions to be fixed and compatibility to be ensured.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>
        These practices will help you improve the maintainability of your code and make it easier to collaborate with your client.
      </em>
    </strong>
